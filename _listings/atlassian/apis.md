  description: |-
    Checks whether the current user has the given permissions. You can optionally provide a specific context to get permissions for (`projectKey` OR `projectId` OR `issueKey` OR `issueId`)

    If there is no context provided, then the project related permissions will return true if the user has that permission in ANY project.

    If a project context is provided, project related permissions will return true if the user has the permissions in the specified project. For permissions that are determined using issue data (e.g Current Assignee), true will be returned if the user meets the permission criteria in ANY issue in that project.

    If an issue context is provided, it will return whether or not the user has each permission in that specific issue.

    The above means that for issue-level permissions (EDIT_ISSUE for example), hasPermission may be true when no context is provided, or when a project context is provided, **but** may be false for any given (or all) issues. This would occur (for example) if Reporters were given the EDIT_ISSUE permission. This is because any user could be a reporter, except in the context of a concrete issue, where the reporter is known.

    Global permissions work in the same way regardless of the scope.

- name: Jira Cloud REST API - Get notification schemes paginated
  x-api-slug: api2notificationscheme-get
  description: |-
    Returns a [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) in order by display name.

    ### About notification schemes

    A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

    *   `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
    *   `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:

    *   `CurrentAssignee`
    *   `Reporter`
    *   `CurrentUser`
    *   `ProjectLead`
    *   `ComponentLead`
    *   `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
    *   `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
    *   `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
    *   `EmailAddress`
    *   `AllWatchers`
    *   `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
    *   `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

    _Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses._

    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the requesting user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.
